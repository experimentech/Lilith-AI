# Final Approach

This document summarizes the chosen approach and rationale. It provides guidance on when specific techniques are appropriate and outlines expected behaviours for query handling and retrieval strategies.

Usage guidance:
- Use retrieval-augmented encoding when external knowledge is large or frequently updated.
- Prefer embedding-based similarity for semantic lookups and keyword matching for high-precision triggers.

Example query handling:
- Queries seeking best-practice recommendations are routed to the pragmatic layer where hybrid retrieval is applied.
