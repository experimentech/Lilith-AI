# Discord Admin Training

This document provides instructions and examples for training administrative responses in the Discord integration. Question/answer examples have been reformatted to a neutral, canonical representation.

Guidelines:
- Provide canonical answers for common administrative queries (refunds, hours, product info).
- Store these entries in the conversation_patterns table with appropriate trigger contexts and success metrics.

Example (canonical representation):
- Question: "What is the refund policy?"
  Answer: "Full refunds are available within 30 days with the original receipt."

Revision history:
- 2025-12-10: Converted conversational Q/A to canonical format.
