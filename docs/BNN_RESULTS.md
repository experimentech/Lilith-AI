# BioNN Results

This report summarizes outcomes from Biological neural network experiments. Sample query descriptions have been replaced with aggregated observations.

Key observations:
- Specific query classes (e.g., recommendation vs information) exhibited differing retrieval accuracy.
- When_query evaluations indicate areas for improved pattern generalization.

Recommendations:
- Focus on calibration of similarity thresholds and increased coverage of training examples for underperforming query classes.

Revision history:
- 2025-12-10: Removed conversational labels and provided aggregated analysis.
