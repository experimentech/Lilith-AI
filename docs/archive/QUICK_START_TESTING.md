# Quick Start: Testing

This guide provides concise instructions for running basic tests and observing learning behaviour. Interactive examples have been replaced with deterministic scripts and descriptions.

Getting started:
1. Execute the provided test harness to run predetermined queries and assertions.
2. Inspect the recorded metrics to confirm expected behaviour.

Notes:
- To observe incremental learning, run the teaching script included in the test directory; it applies labeled pairs to the learning component and verifies persistence.
