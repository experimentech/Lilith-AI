# CLI vs Discord Testing

This document compares behaviour between the command-line interface and the Discord integration. Example user utterances have been removed and replaced with high-level test objectives and results.

Objectives:
- Validate consistency of intent recognition across interfaces.
- Ensure response selection is robust to environment-specific formatting.

Findings:
- Minor differences were observed in text preprocessing; normalize inputs to minimize divergence.

Revision history:
- 2025-12-10: Removed verbatim conversation logs and focused on test objectives and results.
