# Training Guide

This guide outlines standard procedures and exemplar data formats for training the system across various components. Informal conversational snippets have been removed in favour of structured examples.

Data format examples:
- {"user": "3 days", "bot": "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the pain?"}
- {"user": "ORD-12345", "bot": "Acknowledged. Querying shipment status."}

Procedures:
- Use curated datasets for initial training, then apply incremental learning with validated user-supplied corrections.

Revision history:
